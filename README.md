# spider-web-js

This project is a small example of how to draw a spider web using JavaScript and the HTML 5 canvas tag. It supports a variable number of branches as well as light and dark modes.

To run it, clone the repository and open `index.html` in your favorite browser.

Here are a couple of screenshots:
